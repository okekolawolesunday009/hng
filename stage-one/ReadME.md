## Overview
This project is part of the DevOps Stage 1 task, utilizing Python to automate and streamline processes within a DevOps workflow. The goal is to demonstrate foundational DevOps principles by integrating scripting, automation, and infrastructure management.

## Features
- **Automation**: Implements scripts to simplify repetitive tasks.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Uses scripting to manage infrastructure efficiently.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Lays the groundwork for seamless software delivery.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Ensures visibility into system performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core scripting language.
- **Bash**: Integration for shell scripting.
- **Docker (Optional)**: Containerization for deployment.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.

## Setup & Installation
